## Key Features:

- **Streamlit**: Employed the Streamlit framework to develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Streamlit is a Python library that allows for the rapid creation of web-based applications without the need for extensive web development knowledge.The dashboard built using Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore the various analyses and insights generated throughout the project. It includes interactive visualizations, data filtering options, and intuitive navigation, making it easy for the business to consume and act upon the provided recommendations.
- **Product Association Analysis**: Conducted in-depth analysis to identify key cross-selling opportunities.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Implemented techniques that accurately predicted consumer demand, leading to a reduction of excess inventory and an increase in inventory turnover rate.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Utilized data-driven insights to optimize inventory levels, reducing stockouts and improving overall on-shelf availability.

## ML Pre-trained Models/Libraries:

- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, Pandas provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, enabling efficient handling of structured data. It offers functionality for data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation.
- **Mlxtend.frequent_patterns**: This library offers machine learning tools and extensions, including utilities for frequent pattern mining such as the Apriori algorithm and functions to generate association rules, simplifying tasks related to association analysis.
- **Statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters**: A library for statistical modeling, it supports various statistical tests, regression models, and time-series analysis. The ExponentialSmoothing module is particularly useful for demand forecasting and smoothing time-series data.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides detailed control over plots and is widely used for line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and more.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn simplifies the creation of attractive statistical graphics. It is especially useful for drawing informative visualizations based on complex datasets.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Scikit-learn is a powerful Python library for machine learning and data analysis. 
  - **StandardScaler (from sklearn.preprocessing)** : This is a feature scaling method in scikit-learn that standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It is commonly used to normalize input data, ensuring that features are on the same scale, which improves the performance of many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the distribution of input data.
  - **KMeans (from sklearn.cluster)** : KMeans is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering. It partitions data points into k clusters based on their features by minimizing the variance within each cluster. KMeans is widely used in exploratory data analysis and tasks like customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern recognition.
